## Welcome to Randee's Learning Journal 

My name is Randee and I am really going to need to get glasses if I am going to be at the computer this much. In the mean time, here is a link to my [Learning Journal](https://github.com/RandeeOrion)
### A Few Objectives for the Learning Journal
This learning journal will be a place where I can take notes on quesitons I have or topics I have learned about and will be one way I can communicate with Stephanie, the instructor, to ensure I am learning correct deffinitions and techniques.
### Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is the idea that when something is hard, it just means you need to work harder and gain experience. In our house we like to say that 'Something is hard because we've never done it before or because we need more pracice at it, and isn't it great that we can do hard things?'
When I am stuck and want to throw the computer, it will be helpful to remind myself that 
- I have not **yet** met something I could not do at the very least a passable level, once I learned how to do it 
- That I can do hard things 
- If I am stuck, I must simply work harder: after a snack break, _of course_

### Paths in the Terminal
- A relative path is something like the crow flies, while a direct path is something more like directions from google maps; as counter intutive as that seems. When asking for a relative path, we can see that we move from west seattle over the Duwamish river to get to Georgetown. If we are describing a direct path, we have to first move our car from Roxbury to 99 South, then take the exit for Marginal Way and there is Georgetown. When looking for a path we can use the basic comand 'ls file name' to find a relative path and when describing a direct path, we will use ls /folder name /folder name /file name. 
- when in the terminal, to make sure we aren't currenting working in an area we don't want to, we can use the comand 'pwd'
