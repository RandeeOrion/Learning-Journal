## Welcome to Randee's Learning Journal 

My name is Randee and I am really going to need to get glasses if I am going to be at the computer this much. In the mean time, here is a link to my [Learning Journal](https://github.com/RandeeOrion)
### A Few Objectives for the Learning Journal
This learning journal will be a place where I can take notes on quesitons I have or topics I have learned about and will be one way I can communicate with Stephanie, the instructor, to ensure I am learning correct deffinitions and techniques.
### Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is the idea that when something is hard, it just means you need to work harder and gain experience. In our house we like to say that 'Something is hard because we've never done it before or because we need more pracice at it, and isn't it great that we can do hard things?'
When I am stuck and want to throw the computer, it will be helpful to remind myself that 
- I have not **yet** met something I could not do at the very least a passable level, once I learned how to do it 
- That I can do hard things 
- If I am stuck, I must simply work harder: after a snack break, _of course_

### Paths in the Terminal
- A relative path is where a directory is located in realtion to where we currently are in the computer.
- A direct path is where a directory is located in relation to the root system. My undestanding of the root system, is something like a city. If we were to start at, say the north end of the city as a start. We could always give directions to a place in the city starting from that northern point. This would be a direct path. A relative path would be if we gave directions from where we currently were in that city to where we were heading. 
- when in the terminal, to make sure we aren't currenting working in an area we don't want to, we can use the comand 'pwd'
### The Terminal 
- The terminal can be used as way to naviagate throug and between any directory, or folder, and document on the computer, while staying in one program. Files can be created, edited and deleated, anywhere on the computer, from one place. Much like one can grab a train to anywhere trains go, from the train terminal, rather than a train station, which only has access to one train line. Though, really some train stations have a few train lines. 
- The command line is the line that is awaiting a command from the user. Somehow I need to figure out how to progam my dog with a command line. 
### Commands
- pwd tells us where we are. What file or directory are we looking in? 
- ls tells us what files are inside that directory
- we can add arguments to commands to give a more specific command for example, we can chand directories by giving a cd command, but the terminal wont know what directory were headed to. It needs an argument: cd Desktop. now the terminal knows to open the Desktop directory and work from there. 
- When cd is utilized without an argument it will take you back to the home directory. That was a fun discovery after several more complicated attemtps. Though, I then read it later on. 
### Naviation
- When looking for directories, the terminal is not case sensitive nor does it recognize two names in a file, because the space between words is used to tell the command line an argument is coming. To navigate to or make a specific command to a directory with two names quotes, single or double lines, can be used to tell the command line those two words go together OR the back slash can be used to nulify the next character. So, at the end of the first word in the title, a \ can be used, thus making the space that comes next, ignored completely. 
- The terminal does not concern itself with what type of file each directory is. In order to determin what kind of file something is, txt, jpg, gif, etc, the file command can be used.
- Files can be hidden from view, I am still not entirely sure how to do this, but in order to see files that have ben hidden the ls -a command can be used, and files previously hidden will be made visable.
