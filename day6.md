## Javascript

### Javascript: random notes that I hope mean something in the end
- Not all browsers can support javascript, or folks browse with javascript turned off, so it is important to keep it as a seperate file rather than embedding in HTML. 
- Each instruction or step is called a statment 
- Javascript uses {} like CSS
- Each statment should be its own line
- Comments can, and should be used, to tell what your code does 
    - single line comment is marked with a //
    - multi line comment is makred with a /*
