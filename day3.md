### Git: The Wonder Program

- Git is a DVCS: distrivuted Version Control System, which allows a single or a group of users to work on a document locally on their computer and share the work globally on a repository on github, all the while keeping track of who made what changes and when. 
- Git can be operated through a terminal on the computer, allowing the user to acces the code writing program, the master files and the repository on github all from one place.
- Git is really, pretty rad, as it simlifies what could be, and used to be, a deeply complex sytem.
