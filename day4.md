## Introduction to Webdesign  

### Chapter 18

#### Who is the site for
When designing a site, it is important to **KNOW**  who the site is for. 
- Is the site for a specific geneartion? 
- Is the stie specifically for rual or urban dwellers? 
- Is the site for a specific group of people: Dog owners, coffee lovers, performance rally teams? 
- Etc.

#### Why are folks visiting your site?
- Are they looking for constantly updated information? 
    - ie general news or availability of a service
- Are they looking for information about a service or product?
- Are they purchasing goods or services? 
- Are they going to be completing a transation onine? Will they need to conact you? 

It can be helpful to make a variety of fictional users of your site, and as you move along in the design process, you can ask yourself what each user may want or need to help guide decisions. 

#### Site Maps
- In the begining phases of site design, setting up a site map can help keep things clear and organized. 
- Using a card sorting technique can make site maping quick and easy.
    1. Write down each page needed i.e. 
        - History
        - News
        - Contact
        - etc
    2. Write down each naviation tab: 
        - About
        - Make a Reservation
        - Contact
        - etc
    3. Arrange the pages underneath each navigation tab to create a visual outline of where pages are going to be located. Some pages may need to be under more than one navigation tab. 

#### Wire Frames
- Wire frames show how each page will be laid out. 
    - Where the navigation buttos will go
    - Where the logo is
    - Where blocks of text will be 
    - Where photos will be
    - Etc. 
- Wire frames will help ensure each page of a site looks similar and flows.
- Wire frames can help ensure imporant content is placed in a way that will ensure it recieves more attention

#### Designing inside the Frames
- When writting the copy inside the wire frames, ensuring the appropirate content recieves the appropriate amount of attention. 
    - Color, size and style of text can be used to create a visual hierarchy 
    - White space, proximity, boarders, and layout of text blocking can also be used to ensure the reader flows from one peice of information to the next, or doesn't, if that is the desired effect. 

#### Designing Navigation 
- When desiging a navigation bar, ensure it is clear, consise and selective
    - less is often more
- Ensure the navigation buttons provide context, are intereactive and consistent 



### Chapter 7 - Forms

#### Form Control
- There are several ways to add form controls
    - Text
        1. Text input
        2. Password input
        3. Text area
    - Making choices
        1. Buttons 
        2. Check boxes
        3. Dropdown boxes
    - Submiting Forms
        1. submit button
        2. Image buttons, much like a submit button but allows you to use an image.
    - Uploading files
        1. just that, file upload

#### How Forms work: 
1. User fills in a form then presses a button to submit the information to the server
2. The name of each form conrol is sent oth e server along with the value ht user eneters or slects
3. The srever processes the information using a programming languages, such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a data base
4. The server creaes a new page to send back to thebrower based on the information recieved: Thank you for signing up for the newsletter! 

- There may be serveral for controls used in a single form. To keep everyhing straight, the computer uses name / value pairing. 

#### Form Structure 
- Forms can be sent using one of two methogs: Get or Post 
    - Get: this is idea for short forms, such a serach boxes, and when one is simply recieving information from the web server
    - Post: this is idea for longer forms or when the user is sending information, uploading a file, contains sensitive material (passowrds) or adds information to or deletes information from a database 
- If the form attribute is not specified, the form used will automatically be a get form
